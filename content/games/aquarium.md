_"Wacky-quarium is a city builder where you start out building an aquascape to attract beneficial alien sea creatures...but the sea creatures might have a mind of their own."_

Wacky-quarium is my current project right now. Currently it's at a state where it's playable, but I'm missing a lot of the key 'fun' mechanics. The plan right now is to build out a prototype to test the 'fun' factor and then find collaborators to help me finish up and add polish.

In Wacky-quarium, you are an aquascaper trying to populate a biosphere on an alien planet. You start with a grid where you can place structures, like shells and plants. As you place structures down, creatures that are able to live in the conditions you've created will become residents of your biosphere. These fish will create resources that will help you support more variety of fish and build new structures.

The weird part is that your creatures might develop strange wants and needs that might be hard to satisfy. We have enough plants to provide food for our habitat, but what about the squids clamoring for a data archive? As the habitat progresses, you'll need to strategically build and destroy structures, as well as invite and replace inhabitants, in order to fulfill the needs requested of you while keeping your fish alive and happy.

For Agents of Interest, I drew the title screen and the 11 backgrounds (non-character work) used throughout the visual novel. I worked with 5 other people who handled the character art, coding, music, writing and project management, and completed these drawings over two weeks. 

This was my first completed game or art project in several years, and was a good return to what I enjoy about drawing and game development. I utilized real-life references for the external architecture, mainly hotels around my local area, but reimagined the interiors in a futuristic setting, taking inspiration from Cyberpunk 2077. I thoroughly enjoyed painting the lighting and learned a lot from my references. Most of the story had already been written by the time I joined the team, but in future projects I would love to be more creatively involved with the planning of the game.

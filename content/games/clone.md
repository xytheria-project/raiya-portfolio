_"Clone is a 20-level puzzle game in which a boy gets lost in a forest and finds an alternate version of himself. They work together to find a way out. Along the way, he meets more lost individuals and can choose how to interact with them, leading to multiple endings."_

For Clone, I drew most of the tiles and characters and created 2D animations for them in Unity, along with creating the ending cutscenes. I also implemented the dialogue system and added logic to track character responses and deliver the alternate endings. I worked with 3 other developers, who mainly worked on the game logic and puzzle design.

Our goal in making this game was to build an interesting puzzle game with a small story element. The box puzzles were inspired by Baba is You and the story element is inspired by the game Catherine, where you can meet NPCs after doing puzzle sections and choose to comfort or chastise them. The player controlling the main character and another character with inverted controls is inspired by older flash games.

For the art direction, I wanted to stick with cool-toned colors to reflect the somber, mystical mood of the game. We wanted the main character Pero to seem like a normal person lost in a strange place, so that went into his relatively simple design with an orange jacket to contrast the green levels. 

Clone was developed as part of the Game Development and Design DeCal at Berkeley, a student-run class where groups of four were tasked with developing a game together, while learning about art and game development best practices.

Welcome to my page! I'm Raiya (she/they) and I've been making games and art as a hobby for nearly 10 years. Lately I'm focused on taking my projects to a professional level.

I like to consider myself well-balanced on the edge between technical and artistic, and I love learning new things! (to a fault) 

Check out my work to see what I'm about:
